# JavaScript: From First Steps to Professional

Source: [JavaScript: From First Steps to Professional](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-first-steps/)

I am going to start with this course. I already am familiar with a lot of what is being taught here. However, that mentality gives me itchiness and so I will set it aside.

I will not be going through this course video by video; there will be a lot of speeding up, but I will do my best to not get caught up in the feeling of "I already know this" which makes me impatient. I am positive that a patient attitude will reap rewards. 

Plus, the foundations are so crucial.
